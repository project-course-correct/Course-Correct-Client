# Course Correct App Landing Page
[View Live](https://course-correct-landing.netlify.com/)
This app allows prison management to broadcast the skill of inmates to make better use of their time using their skills to make a wage and becoming more employable after incarceration. 


The Landing Page serves two purposes:
  1. Provide an accessible entry point for a correctional facility admin to log into the app.
  2. Establish an online presence that attracts potential employers and enables them to search for employees.
